    "### Variables\n",
    "When a program runs, any data that it uses must be stored in **RAM**. A variable is a name made up by the programmer to identify the address in RAM where a particular piece of data is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Type | Used for storing |\n",
    "| ------------|-----------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Integer** | Whole numbers e.g. 4, 10, -12 |\n",
    "| **Real** | Numbers with decimal places e.g. 3.14 |\n",
    "| **Character** | One character e.g. 'a', 'z', '9', '@' |\n",
    "| **String** | Text e.g. 'Hello World!' |\n",
    "| **Boolean** | True or False |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaring Variables\n",
    "To declare a variable means to tell Python two things about it:\n",
    " 1. Its name\n",
    " 2. Its initial value\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "`age = 14`\n",

    "\n",
    "`surname = 'Mason'`\n",
    "\n",
    "`ownsCar = True`\n",
    "\n",
    "When naming variables there are some rules that you must follow:\n",
    "- Must begin with a letter (a-z, A-B) or underscore (_)\n",
    "There are some reserved words which you cannot use as a variable name because Python uses them for other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some **good practices** that programmers should try to abide by\n",
    "- numPupils is meaningful instead of np.\n",
    "- Be consistent â€“ num_pupils or numPupils \n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Activity 1 - Input and Output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program Specification\n",
    "Your task is to create a program that will allow the user to enter their name and age. The program will then display a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "name = input('What is your name?  ')\n",
    "age = int(input('What is your age? '))\n",
